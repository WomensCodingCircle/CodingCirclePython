    "# Password Hacker\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to create a program that trys to hack users passwords given a list of the top 500 (450 with the explicit ones taken out) most common passwords (available in passwords.txt). You will also add in some common trick that people use to make their password 'more secure' like adding numbers or special characters to the end of a word. This will be an eye opener to how easily passwords can be hacked.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you will have a list of usernames for the site you want to hack `user_list` imported from the password_check module that I wrote. You will also have access to a function `check_user_pass` that takes as parameters `username` and `password` and will return True if `password` is `username`'s password and False if it is not a match. (Imagine it is like you checking by logging into a website)\n",
    "\n",
    "    #example\n",
    "    check_user_pass('Olivia', '123456') # -> True\n",
    "    check_user_pass('Olivia', '13579') # -> False\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the functions starting with `getallpasswords`, and run the code. See if you can hack all seven user's passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a project, the training wheels are off. Instead of telling you how to do something I'm only going to tell you what to do, and you can figure out the rest. I encourage you to look back over old lessons and to take your time, this should take much longer than other end of lesson projects."
