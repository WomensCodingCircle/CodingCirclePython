    "What is JSON? From JSON.org:\n",
    "\n",
    "    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "But that isn't exactly helpful is it? JSON is a string format that allows you to store dictionaries, lists, strings, and numbers in a way that you can pass it from one source to another. You can take a Python dictionary and pass it to a perl program by printing it in JSON format and loading it or you can pull data from the web and create a python dictionary or list from that. Even if you don't understand now, after you use it, JSON will become more clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have in this folder a json file called `shapes.json`. Take a look at it and then we can talk about JSON format.\n",
